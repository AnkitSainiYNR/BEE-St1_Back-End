# BEE-St1_Back-End

The app name is TRAVEL BLOGS

For the Backend Part, I used NodeJS, and ExpressJS.
I used MongoDB Database to store data of the users and blogs which i have posted.

Even i can Use CRUD Operations: 
C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete

If a user want to delete blog from other account,
then it will not allow to user to delete blog written by another user.
